title: "All about my work experience at a SaaS Company!"
---

Hello and welcome to this new post, where I share all the very interesting things I learnt on my work experience day at TopScore Technologies, a software as a service (SaaS) company that provides virtual assessment software.

## What does the company do?

Before I get into the actual work day, I'd like to explain what the company actually does! This was explained to me early on in the day, by one of the comapany's account managers.

TopScore provides a platform for companies to carry out completely virtual assessments, when hiring candidates in bulk (hiring new graduates, apprentices etc).

Before TopScore, when companies would hire in bulk, all the assessors and candidates would go to an **assessment centre** and carry out all the assessments of the candidates they needed to do there. Assessors had to bring thousands and thousands of pieces of paper, all used to note down the performance of each candidate. 

This of course was a huge hassle, as papers would often get lost, get coffee split on and there also the huge cost of printing and transporting all the paper. In terms of data privacy, the papers often had candidates' private information on there, so if that was to be lost on a train/bus, it could easily get into wrong hands.

TopScore allows comapanies to get rid of ALL of the hassle caused by manual assessment centres by providing a 100% virtual assessment centre.

The platform provides a dashboard of scores and reports, in-built video-conferencing, automated scheduling, digital note-taking and report writing and much much more. It not only gets rid of all that paper used in manual assessment centres, but it also goes beyond by providing companies the ability to assess people from a wide range of places all at once, especially due to the in-built video conferencing. In the height of the pandemic, TopScore was huge in demand as a result, due to its ability to allow companies to still hire bulk, even when nobody was allowed out their homes! But it's still doing well even after the height of the pandemic, since it can easily be used for in-person assessment centres, providing a way for everything to operate paperless-ly. 

Their clients include Tesco, BT and BAE Systems just to name a few...

## Morning Stand-Up

The day began with what is called a **stand-up**. In a stand-up, everyone takes turns to say what they did yesterday, what they will do today and if there are any blockers. Blockers are just anything that stops them from doing what they had planned for the day. 

I found it really interesting to watch because I always wondered how different sections of a company would efficiently work together and how they would overcome any obstacles caused by their dependence on other sections of the company. A stand-up is a quick, yet effective way of doing so, since it lets everyone prioritise what they need to do in their day in a short space of time, even before the day has started!

## Release Notes

A few hours after the morning stand-up, I had a short talk with the co-founder of the company! There he showed me the process of how he makes release notes and sending them to clients.

A release note is a small document that outlines the new recent changes made to the product. In the release notes I saw, there were around 3 to 4 updates outlined in each release note and they were sent out each month - so it shows the company was always busy and improving the product, which would obviously impress clients!

Clients often did comment on the release notes too, saying they were excited by the new changes, showing that clients are very enganged with the product they use!

## Catch-Up Call with BT Openreach

Soon after that call, I got to watch a call between one of the account managers and some of the guys at Openreach, who have been using the product for quite some time.

Since TopScore provides its software as a customised web-application to each of its clients, an account manager is needed for each client.

An account manager at TopScore is assigned certain clients and is responsible for communicating with the client, setting up their site and taking any feedback the client gives.

The catch-up calls with Openreach happen every 2 weeks, where they talk about any new changes they would like with the product and give feedback on anything new they might have used. In the call I was in, they also talked about how much they'd use the product later on in the year (they said they'd use it a lot!), which allowed for a projection of how much money would be made from this client for the rest of the year (it was a big big number)!

I was surprised by how casual the conversation was! I was expecting it to be a bit more formal, considering it was a professional environment, but it was good to see it being slightly laid back, yet still professional and a few laughs go around. To me, it highlighted the importance of keeping a friendly relationship with clients and not talk business all the time, since clients can often stay just because they like the people they're with!

## Developer Call

As an aspiring software engineer, this was the part of the day which I looked most forward to.

I've always wondered about how developers in big companies approach the projects they are assigned with and this was explained to me by the developer!

Projects start off with a PID (Project Initiation Document), which details the main features the project needs and an estimation of how long each feature would take. The PID may be sent to higher management for approval. 

The project should then have a set end date and, therefore, last a certain number of sprints.

A sprint is a short, repeatable period of time (usually 1 to 4 weeks), where each sprint should result in a prototype of the final product. Companies can plan and adjust future sprints based on the results of the sprint they just came out of. Sprints break down a project into small chunks, therefore making teams incredibly efficient. 

Around the beginning of the project, the following tasks may be done:
* Feature changes will be scoped (gather detailed requirements and try to find flaws/caveats)
* More detailed design may take place for the features
* They can then be broken into individual tickets and storypointed (storypoints measure an estimate for how much effort you need to implement a change)

A ticket is something that describes a small change needed and is given an ID.

In TopScore, when a developer needs to make a change, they take the relevant ticket and create a git branch, which is named with the ticket ID and a very short description (e.g 1234-change-btn-colour) and implement the changes they need to in that branch.

Near the end of the project, there is more focus on the quality of the product and fixing bugs
* There are regression testing sprints, mainly done by the QA (Quality Assurance) team
* They will test the majority of functionality of the system, and look for bugs/mistakes
* During or after that sprint, developers will fix those bugs and get them tested again
* And before release, QAs might do a final smoke test just in case something critical has broken

After all that, the software is released and a new project is started!

##  Last Call of the Day

The final part of my day was getting to see how an account manager would set up a client's site!

This included branding the pages to suit the client company, entering the assessors and clients.

Despite this being a company specific thing, rather than about something you'd see in a general workplace, I still took away some  important things from it. 

For example, the branding of the site (e.g using the client's logo and changing the pages' colour scheme) was all done from a dashboard, developed by one of the developers at TopScore. It made me realise that not all the work done by a company is for its clients and often can be for themselves, usually to increase their own efficiency. 

Setting up the site also seemed like a long and tedious task to me, however all the account managers said they didn't mind it at all and quite enjoyed doing so, which highlighted how important it is to have passion in what you do. It also showed me the huge amount of hard work people put in before a product is given to its users, which can easily be overlooked!

## Thank you

Thank you for reading through this post and thank you especially to the people at TopScore for  giving me a very exciting and interesting insight into life at work! I am very grateful for everything that I took away from that day.
